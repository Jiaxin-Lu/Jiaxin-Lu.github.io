# Misc.

I am the runner and editor of the official account of our class 'ACMClass2018'. I am also a member of student organizing team of ACM-Class Student Academic Festival 2021.

I am a cinephile. My favorite directors includes Damien Chazelle, Agnès Varda, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, and many more. I am a member of student group 800 Movie Theater and hosted several salons and weekend theaters.

I love graphic design and have designed many posters. You can find some of my works [**here**](gallery). I was selected as one of 20 finalists of the world-wide open creative brief "Design artwork inspired by Daniel Craig's Bond films". I also designed a theme poster for "Berlin Feminist Film Week at BATURU".
