**[News]** I will join Wormpex AI Research Institute as a Research Intern advised by Dr. Gang Hua this summer.

**[News]** Graduated!!! I graduated with Zhiyuan Honor Degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology. I also won Shanghai Excellent Graduate Award and Zhiyuan Outstanding Student Scholarship.

**[News]** My bachelor thesis **'Machine Learning Methods on Graph Matching'** is awarded the prize of 2022 Excellent Bachelor Thesis (Top 1%) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.


# Research Interests

My research interests lie in the **machine learning** algorithms. I am particularly interested in their applications on **computer graphics** and **computer vision**. I am currently working on learning for 3D fracture assembly problem. I worked on mesh parameterization and graph matching problems during my undergraduate studies.
