**[News]** Graduated!!! I graduated with Zhiyuan Honor Degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology. I also won Shanghai Excellent Graduate Award and Zhiyuan Outstanding Student Scholarship.

**[News]** My bachelor thesis **'Machine Learning Methods on Graph Matching'** is awarded the prize of 2022 Excellent Bachelor Thesis (Top 1%) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

**[News]** I will be joining UT Austin as a PhD student starting 22Fall!


# Research Interests

My research interests lie in the **machine learning** algorithms. I am particularly interested in their applications on **computer graphics** and **computer vision**. I am also interested in using **geometry processing** techniques to develop better machine learning algorithms. I am currently working on a project using geometric property to study the robustness and generalization ability of learning models. I worked on mesh parameterization and graph matching problems during my undergraduate studies.

# Misc.

I am the runner and editor of the official account of our class 'ACMClass2018'. I am also a member of student organizing team of ACM-Class Student Academic Festival 2021.

I am a cinephile. My favorite directors includes Damien Chazelle, Agnès Varda, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, and many more. I am a member of student group 800 Movie Theater and hosted several salons and weekend theaters.

I love graphic design and video editing. You can find some of my works [**here**](gallery). I was selected as one of 20 finalists of the world-wide open creative brief "Design artwork inspired by Daniel Craig's Bond films". I also designed a theme poster for "Berlin Feminist Film Week at BATURU".
