# Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **computer graphics**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on addressing challenges related to 3D object geometric analysis. Currently, my research focuses on the 3D fracture assembly problem and dexterous grasp generation. With a background in graph matching and mesh parameterization, I aim to develop algorithms that enable efficient and accurate representation for 3D world.

# Misc.

I am a cinephile. My favorite directors includes Damien Chazelle, Agnès Varda, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, and many more. I am a member of student group 800 Movie Theater and hosted several salons and weekend theaters.

I love graphic design and video editing. You can find some of my works [**here**](gallery). I was selected as one of 20 finalists of the world-wide open creative brief "Design artwork inspired by Daniel Craig's Bond films". I also designed a theme poster for "Berlin Feminist Film Week at BATURU".
