abstract: We analyze the partial matching problem and reveal the limitations of existing methods on distinguishing unmatched inlier and outliers. Based on a universe matching perspective, we build an end-to-end learning pipeline including universe metric learning scheme and OOD detection. Our method UGM significantly outperforms SOTA on main-stream datasets. It is also the first deep learning method that can deal with different complex extension cases simultaneously, reaching a notably accelerated matching process and less space utilization as well.

## Abstract

Partial matching is a kind of graph matching where only part of two graphs can be aligned. This problem is particularly important in computer vision applications, where challenges like point occlusion or annotation errors often occur when labeling key points. Previous work has often conflated point occlusion and annotation errors, despite their distinct underlying causes. We propose two components to address these challenges: (1) a structured universe graph is learned to connect two input graphs 
, effectively resolving the issue of point occlusion; (2) an energy-based out-of-distribution detection is designed to remove annotation errors from the input graphs before matching. We evaluated our method on the Pascal VOC and Willow Object datasets, focusing on scenarios involving point occlusion and random outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all tested scenarios, highlighting the accuracy and robustness of our method.
