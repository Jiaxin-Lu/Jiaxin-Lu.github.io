abstract: We propose an efficient MM-based algorithm M3C that iteratively tackling graph matching and clustering problem. Based on M3C, an unsupervised learning model UM3C is further developed which is equipped with our devised edge-wise affinity learning and pseudo label selection techniques. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our method notably surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, where our unsupervised model even exceeds supervised methods.

## Abstract

Given a batch of graphs that often do not share the same or similar structure in real-world scenarios, one challenging and important task is to cluster the graphs into groups and further find the node correspondences among the graphs within each group. In fact, matching and clustering are two interleaved tasks and a joint approach is attractive yet rarely studied. This work aims to push forward the graph matching models to this more general setting: mixture graph matching and clustering. Specifically, a theoretically convergent Majorization Minimization style algorithm namely M3C is devised for joint matching and clustering. Based on M3C, an unsupervised learning model UM3C is further developed which is equipped with our devised edge-wise affinity learning and pseudo label selection techniques. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our method notably surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, where our unsupervised model even exceeds supervised methods.
