abstract: We propose an efficient MM-based algorithm M3C that iteratively tackling graph matching and clustering problem. Based on M3C, an unsupervised learning model UM3C is further developed which is equipped with our devised edge-wise affinity learning and pseudo label selection techniques. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our method notably surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, where our unsupervised model even exceeds supervised methods.

## Abstract

Given a batch of graphs that often do not share the same or similar structure in real-world scenarios, a challenging task is to cluster the graphs into groups and find the node correspondences among the graphs within each group. In fact, matching and clustering are two interleaved tasks and a joint approach is attractive yet rarely studied. This work aims to push forward the graph matching models to this more general setting: mixture graph matching and clustering. M3C is designed with theoretical convergence brought by Minorize-maximization framework and flexible optimization space via cluster relaxation. Based on M3C, an unsupervised learning model UM3C is further developed, which is equipped with our proposed edge-wise affinity learning and pseudo label selection techniques. Experiment results on public benchmarks show that our method notably surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, where our unsupervised model even exceeds supervised methods.
